# Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach Nextbots (Deluxe)

The beginning of my nextbot workshop career was with the Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach NextBots. Originally we had very limited knowledge of how the Source Engine worked and only managed to make it look better by meeting some talented people. Now 4 years later the team is back together with new tricks, new methods, and new people aiming to make the best Security Breach NextBot pack. This is made purely out of passion and not out of money or jealousy.
